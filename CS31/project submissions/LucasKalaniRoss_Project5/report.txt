The main problem I had was figuring out how to not double-count certain letters as both stars and planets, or even just double-counting certain letters as two planets. I used the examples on the spec (EGRET compared with 9 different guesses) and ran into notable difficulty with EERIE and RAGE because of how the planets were counted. I ended up just copying the chosen word and trial word into new C strings and modifying those (replacing the letters with non-alpha lowercase characters, I used 'X') as I counted stars and planets. I'm sure there's a more space-efficient solution, though.

===================

int runOneRound(const char words[][7], int nWords, int wordnum) pseudocode:

if number of words is negative,
	return -1
if index of chosen word is outside the bounds of word list,
	return -1
locate and save chosen word in word list
save chosen word length
set round score to 0
repeatedly:
	set number of planets to 0
	set number of stars to 0
	write a prompt for trial word
	read trial word from input buffer
	save trial word length
	if trial word not 4-6 lowercase letters,
		write that trial word must be 4-6 lowercase letters
		continue
	else if trial word not in word list,
		write that trial word is unknown
		continue
	otherwise,
		increment round score
	if trial word is chosen word,
		break
	save copy of trial word
	save copy of chosen word
	for every index in trial word:
		if letter at that index matches for trial and chosen word,
			increment number of stars
			cross off that letter in trial word copy
			cross off that letter in chosen word copy
	for every index in trial word:
		save pointer to first character in chosen word copy that matches character at that index in trial word
		if pointer not null pointer,
			save index of character in chosen word copy that pointer points to
			if character at new index in chosen word copy not crossed off and character at index in trial word copy not crossed off,
				increment number of planets
				cross off character at new index in chosen word copy
				cross off character at index in trial word copy
	write number of stars and number of planets
return round score

===================

void updateStatistics(int curr_score, int* min, int* max, double* sum, int rounds_played) psuedocode:

if minimum score is -1,
	set minimum score to current score
if maximum score is -1,
	set maximum score to current score
if current score less than minimum score,
	set minimum score to current score
if current score greater than maximum score,
	set maximum score to current score
add current score to sum
set decimal formatting to two degrees of precision
write average score as sum divided by total rounds played, minimum score, maximum score 
	
===================

int main() pseudocode:

download word list
if download fails,
	write error message
	return 0
write a prompt for number of rounds
read number of rounds
if number of rounds is negative,
	write error message
	return 0
ignore next 10000 characters or until new line character in input buffer
set minimum score to -1
set maximim score to -1
set sum to 0.0
for each round:
	write round number
	generate and save random index between 0 and number of words - 1
	locate chosen word in word list
	write length of chosen word
	run one round and save round score
	if round score is -1,
		write error message
		return 0
	if round score is 1,
		write special round score message
	otherwise,
		write generic round score message
	update game statistics and write current game statistics
return 0
